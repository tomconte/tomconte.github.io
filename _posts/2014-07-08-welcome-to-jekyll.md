Well, this is the first post on my brand new [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)-powered blog, hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

I have finally decided I had spent too much time fighting with crappy CMS interfaces and HTML "WYSIWYG" editors and that I wanted a simple and bare bones solution to host my blog posts! Jekyll lets you publish a blog simply based on static pages. You can write in Markdown, which keeps the pages simple and allows you to easily include code snippets with proper syntax highlighting. This is all I need!

I have found a nice and clean Jekyll theme called [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/) and this is what I am using right now. I have chosen to host on GitHub Pages for now just because it looked like the simplest solution, but I will look into moving the hosting to Azure Blob Storage.

I have migrated some old documents and blog posts that I used to store in GitHub, and that I also published on my [MSDN Blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/tconte/). I have been writing mostly in Markdown for a few months now, and I used to convert the articles to HTML and then copy/paste that into the blog platform editor and then fix by hand all the mess it produced. The publishing process is much easier with Jekyll.

I expect I will be writing here more often!

More to come soon!
